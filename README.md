Invoice-System

This is a starter project as I begin to learn Xamarin. The invoicing system provides a mobile utility to the end user by allowing them to create and manage invoices and customer profiles.

Invoicing System

Scope

System Description

The invoicing system is a program built to provide an invoicing utility for the end user. Once the user logs in, they can create an invoice, search all prior invoices, and have access to a customer repository which will have a search option.

The program will access a local database on the userâ€™s device for now. Future iterations will implement a remote database. This database will have at least four tables, one for customer information, invoice storage, user information, and job storage. A third table might be added for each individual job task within each invoice.

Future iterations will also allow the user to modify their own profile which will have such information as business information, contact information, hourly rates, and more. This information would be used to populate the invoice that would be emailed to the user/customer.
